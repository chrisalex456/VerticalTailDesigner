# Aircraft Stability Analysis: Vertical Tail Design Tradeoffs

This MATLAB project explores how vertical tail geometry affects aircraft static and dynamic stability characteristics. It models lift, roll/yaw moments, and damping behavior across a range of design variables.

## 📌 Objective
Analyze vertical tail sizing and positioning to optimize aerodynamic stability in early aircraft design.

## ✈️ Methods
- MATLAB scripts perform parameter sweeps on vertical tail geometry.
- Key stability derivatives (Clb, CnB, Cnr) are calculated.
- Mesh plots visualize sensitivity to geometry changes.

## 🧠 Key Takeaways
- Roll and yaw stability improve with increased tail height and CG distance.
- Effective rudder deflection requires a well-placed and sized vertical tail.
- Results can inform conceptual aircraft design in industry or academia.
